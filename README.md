Hi, I'm Ruhan and I'm currently a student of grade 9th. I'm interested in various topics like AI, Particle Physics, Astrophysics,
Neuroscience, Nanobiotechnology, Mathematics(any kind of math is fun for me) and of course Computer Programming. I also like 
to watch animes and read mangas, webtoons, webnovels etc. I can also code in python and learnt basic things like HTML and CSS a
bit. I'm trying to improve my coding skills and portfolio, so I've opened this github account as a way to contribute in the 
github community.
